A touch-enabled collaborative drawing app for projection work

It's pretty inefficient right now, and allows infinite layers, which is not a good idea. Updates every half-second, which is a pain for the server. Bogs down on initial load if there are too many layers.

Uses canvas and uses data URLs, so we can do 'erase' if we want to in the future but why bother.

Todo:

* needs some bootstrappery maybe
* limit # of layers to, maybe 2 or 3, notify user that you can only watch after that
* distinguish between "draw" and "watch" - currently you are just watching unless you start to draw

Thoughts:

We could do this purely P2P using PeerConnect or faster with sockets, and maybe just share a canvas instead of having layers? There'd probably have to be a "host".
